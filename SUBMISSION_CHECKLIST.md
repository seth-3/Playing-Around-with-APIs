## Commands You'll Need to Execute

### Once Docker is Running:
```bash
# 1. Build the image
docker build -t <your-dockerhub-username>/currency-exchange:v1 .

# 2. Test locally
docker run -p 8080:8080 <your-dockerhub-username>/currency-exchange:v1

# 3. Login to Docker Hub
docker login

# 4. Push to Docker Hub  
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/currency-exchange:v1
docker tag <your-dockerhub-username>/currency-exchange:v1 <your-dockerhub-username>/currency-exchange:latest
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/currency-exchange:latest
```

### For Git (after creating GitHub repo):
